2. **[Java Multithreading & Concurrency](./java-multithreading.md)** - Deep dive into threads, synchronization, Java Memory Model, concurrent collections, executors, locks, atomic operations, Fork/Join, CompletableFuture, best practices

3. **[Spring & Spring Boot](./spring-boot.md)** - Spring Core, dependency injection, Spring Boot, annotations, MVC, REST, Spring Data JPA, Security, AOP

4. **[Microservices Patterns](./microservices-patterns.md)** - Microservices architecture, communication patterns, Saga, CQRS, Event Sourcing, API Gateway, Circuit Breaker

5. **[System Design](./system-design.md)** - Scalability, CAP theorem, load balancing, caching, database sharding, real-world system designs

6. **[Distributed Systems & Architecture](./distributed-systems-architecture.md)** - Distributed computing, consistency models, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, architectural principles

7. **[Docker & Kubernetes](./docker-kubernetes.md)** - Containerization, Docker, Kubernetes, orchestration, deployments, monitoring

8. **[Design Patterns & SOLID Principles](./design-patterns-solid.md)** - SOLID principles, creational/structural/behavioral patterns, enterprise patterns

9. **[Database & Caching](./database-caching.md)** - SQL/NoSQL, query optimization, transactions, indexing, caching strategies, Redis

10. **[Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture](./messaging-event-driven.md)** - Message queues, Kafka, RabbitMQ, event-driven architecture, delivery guarantees

## ðŸ“– What Each File Contains

Each file includes:
- âœ… Detailed Q&A format with explanations
- âœ… Code examples in Java
- âœ… Best practices and real-world implementations
- âœ… Common pitfalls and solutions
- âœ… Trade-offs and decision criteria

## ðŸŽ¯ Coverage

The materials cover all the topics you mentioned and include content from the research I was able to gather. Each file is structured with a table of contents for easy navigation and covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Guide

1. Start with the fundamentals if you need a refresher on core Java concepts
2. Move through each topic based on your interview requirements
3. Practice coding the examples provided
4. Review the best practices and common pitfalls sections
5. Use the Q&A format to practice answering interview questions

## ðŸ’¡ Interview Tips

- Understand concepts deeply rather than memorizing answers
- Be prepared to write code on a whiteboard or in a coding environment
- Always discuss trade-offs when presenting solutions
- Use concrete examples from your experience when possible
- Ask clarifying questions before diving into solutions

Good luck with your senior Java interview! ðŸŽ¯
