# Feature: Distributed Systems & Architecture Content

## What
Interview preparation content covering distributed computing principles, consistency models, consensus algorithms, fault tolerance mechanisms, and architectural principles for building distributed systems.

## Why
Senior Java developers working on enterprise systems need deep understanding of distributed systems concepts. This content covers theoretical foundations and practical implementations of distributed system patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Covers distributed computing fundamentals
- [ ] Explains consistency models (strong, eventual, causal)
- [ ] Documents consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft)
- [ ] Covers fault tolerance mechanisms
- [ ] Explains architectural principles (SOLID at system level)
- [ ] Documents distributed data patterns
- [ ] Covers partition tolerance strategies
- [ ] Includes real-world examples and trade-offs

## Content Sections
1. Distributed Computing Fundamentals
2. Consistency Models
3. Consensus Algorithms
4. Fault Tolerance
5. Architectural Principles
6. Distributed Data Patterns
7. Partition Tolerance
8. Real-World Applications
