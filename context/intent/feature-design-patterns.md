# Feature: Design Patterns & SOLID Principles Content

## What
Interview preparation content covering SOLID principles, creational/structural/behavioral design patterns (GoF), enterprise patterns, anti-patterns, and pattern selection guidelines with trade-off analysis.

## Why
Design patterns and SOLID principles are fundamental to writing maintainable, extensible code. Senior developers must demonstrate ability to apply appropriate patterns and explain their trade-offs in interviews.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Covers all SOLID principles with examples
- [ ] Documents creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, etc.)
- [ ] Covers structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade, etc.)
- [ ] Documents behavioral patterns (Strategy, Observer, Command, etc.)
- [ ] Covers enterprise patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, etc.)
- [ ] Documents common anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] Includes pattern selection guidelines
- [ ] Provides trade-off analysis for pattern choices
