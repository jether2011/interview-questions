# Feature: Messaging & Event-Driven Architecture Content

## What
Interview preparation content covering message queues, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, event-driven architecture patterns, message delivery guarantees, and async communication patterns for distributed systems.

## Why
Modern distributed systems rely heavily on asynchronous messaging. Senior developers need to understand messaging patterns, event-driven architecture, and when to apply different messaging technologies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Covers message queue fundamentals
- [ ] Explains Apache Kafka architecture and patterns
- [ ] Documents RabbitMQ concepts and exchange types
- [ ] Covers event-driven architecture patterns
- [ ] Explains message delivery guarantees (at-least-once, exactly-once)
- [ ] Documents event sourcing integration
- [ ] Covers dead letter queues and error handling
- [ ] Includes comparison of messaging technologies

## Content Sections
1. Message Queue Fundamentals
2. Apache Kafka
3. RabbitMQ
4. Event-Driven Architecture
5. Delivery Guarantees
6. Event Sourcing Integration
7. Error Handling Patterns
8. Technology Comparison
