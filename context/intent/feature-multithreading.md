# Feature: Java Multithreading & Concurrency Content

## What
Deep-dive interview preparation content covering Java multithreading, concurrency mechanisms, thread synchronization, Java Memory Model, concurrent collections, executors, locks, and modern concurrency patterns.

## Why
Multithreading is a critical topic for senior Java interviews as it demonstrates understanding of complex concurrent programming. This content helps developers master thread safety, synchronization, and modern concurrency APIs.

## Acceptance Criteria
