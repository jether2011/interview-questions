## [2026-01-19] - Enhanced Feature Documentation

### Changed
All 10 feature intent files enhanced with comprehensive content for better interview study experience:

- **feature-java-fundamentals.md** - Added detailed explanations for each content section (Core Java, Collections, Memory, GC, Java 8+), key concepts to master, and study tips
- **feature-multithreading.md** - Expanded with thread lifecycle, synchronization mechanisms, JMM concepts, concurrent collections, and practical study guidance
- **feature-spring-boot.md** - Enhanced with Spring Core, DI patterns, Boot auto-configuration, MVC/REST, JPA, Security, and AOP details
- **feature-microservices.md** - Added comprehensive coverage of communication patterns, Saga, CQRS, resilience patterns, and service mesh concepts
- **feature-system-design.md** - Expanded with scalability fundamentals, CAP theorem implications, caching strategies, sharding techniques, and real-world design examples
- **feature-distributed-systems.md** - Enhanced with consistency models, consensus algorithms (Paxos, Raft), fault tolerance, and distributed data patterns
- **feature-docker-kubernetes.md** - Added Docker internals, Kubernetes architecture, workloads, services, deployment strategies, and Helm
- **feature-design-patterns.md** - Expanded SOLID principles, all GoF patterns, enterprise patterns, and anti-patterns with detailed explanations
- **feature-database-caching.md** - Enhanced with SQL/NoSQL deep dives, transaction isolation levels, indexing strategies, caching patterns, and Redis data structures
- **feature-messaging.md** - Added Kafka architecture, RabbitMQ concepts, event-driven patterns, delivery guarantees, and error handling strategies

### Improvements Applied to All Features
Each feature file now includes:
1. **Expanded "What" section** - Comprehensive description of coverage scope
2. **Expanded "Why" section** - Specific benefits, learning outcomes, and interview relevance
3. **Detailed Content Sections** - Each section with key topics and concepts explained
4. **Key Concepts to Master** - Critical topics that interviewers commonly ask about
5. **Study Tips** - Practical guidance for effective preparation

### Context Updates
- Updated all 10 feature intent files with enhanced documentation
- Added "Updated" field to Status section of each feature file

### Reason for Change
To improve the study experience by providing more detailed explanations rather than just topic listings, making the feature documentation more useful for interview preparation.
